Getting Started
---------------

To generate data, use the genphantomdata.py script.  Running the command:

$ ./genphantomdata.py 40000 1AON.mrc examplectfs.par Data/1AON

will generate a stack of 40,000 randomly distributed views of the density in 1AON.mrc using the CTF parameters specified in the (supplied) par file.

Once data has been generated, you can run the reconstruction with the command:

$ ./runexp.py exp/1AON_sagd_is

and follow it's progress with:

$ tail -f exp/1AON_sagd_is/stdout

Plots showing the current state of the reconstruction can be seen by using IPython:

$ ipython --pylab=qt

To update the displays, call vis.dowork():

Running other data
------------------

Currently the code can only handle specific forms of input.  Images must be in MRC stack files, CTF parameters must be estimated and provided in the form of a defocus.txt or .par file.  The bfactor and other microscope parameters must be set by hand in the exp/*/*.params files.
